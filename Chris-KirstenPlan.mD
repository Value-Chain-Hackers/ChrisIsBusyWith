- Full-Day Engagement: €2,000  
  Adds sprint planning session and custom toolkit

- Extended Track: €3,500+  
  Includes 2–3 sessions, implementation check-in, and habit adoption follow-up

### 🔥 Why This Offer Works
- You’ve both successfully delivered agile education and innovation sessions before
- No new tech or tools are required — this offer runs on your existing simulations and facilitation experience
- It’s energizing, easy to promote, and delivers visible results within a day
- It positions you as a team that can bridge the gap between ideas and systems

### 🚫 What This Is Not
- Not a technical product training (no agile software tutorials)
- Not a one-size-fits-all workshop — sessions are customized based on team needs
- Not a consulting engagement — it’s a high-impact starting point that can evolve

## ✅ Use A.I. Responsibly: Strategic Workshop for Ethical Adoption (Realistic Version)

### 🎯 What We Deliver
- A live 1-day workshop (or 2 shorter sessions) introducing teams to practical, privacy-first AI use
- A guided demo of a local AI assistant (OpenWebUI + Ollama) with discussion on when and how to use it
- Interactive exercises to map which tasks AI can help with, and which should remain human-led
- Facilitation of ethical alignment: how your team defines trust, control, and usefulness in AI adoption
- Optional takeaway template: “AI Team Charter” or “Use Case Canvas”

### 👥 Ideal Clients
- Nonprofits, universities, and SMEs exploring AI adoption but wary of hype or risk
- HR and innovation teams looking for internal clarity before investing in tooling
- Ethical startups or accelerators wanting to train their teams before integrating LLMs
- Municipalities or education teams trying to build literacy around responsible AI use

### 🧰 Tools (Current Stack)
- OpenWebUI and Ollama for local LLM demo (curated and tested beforehand)
- Slide-based or paper-based role-mapping and AI/human task sorting
- Markdown, PDF, or Notion-based canvases
- No coding, no cloud, no API keys required

### 🔧 Roles & Responsibilities

#### Kirsten Coppoolse
- Frames the ethical and organizational narrative: why use AI, when not to, what trust means
- Facilitates scenario-based reflection and value-alignment discussion
- Collects participant feedback and helps interpret team alignment
- Crafts accessible storytelling around the risks and trade-offs

#### Christiaan Verhoef
- Prepares and runs the AI demo (OpenWebUI, Ollama setup)
- Facilitates technical Q&A and workflow translation (what's realistic, what’s not)
- Supports the mapping of use cases and automation boundaries
- Delivers optional follow-up materials (Markdown or Notion summary)

### 💸 Pricing
- Intro Workshop: €2,000  
  Includes AI demo, discussion exercises, and basic takeaway template

- Full Engagement: €3,500  
  Adds deeper team alignment, ethical framework, and 2-part delivery with follow-up

- Optional Add-On:  
  Technical setup session (on client hardware): €750–€1,200 depending on scope

### 🔥 Why This Offer Works (Critically Speaking)
- It meets high demand — but stays grounded in what you can confidently deliver now
- It positions you as ethical, realistic, and independent of Big Tech platforms
- It requires minimal development — the tools are already running locally
- It can easily lead to culture, training, or infrastructure follow-up work

### 🚫 What This Is Not
- Not a technical build-out or automation delivery
- Not an AI product workshop or ML training
- Not a replacement for full AI ops consulting — this is exploration and literacy

| Concern                            | Why It Matters                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hype vs. Value Gap**             | Many orgs are confused. They say “AI” but mean “chatbot” or “automation.” You risk being asked for what you don’t offer. |
| **Delivery Fragility**             | If you promise too much and the tools glitch (e.g., Ollama breaks, LLM fails), trust is lost.                            |
| **Your Stack is Not Fully Ready**  | You’re still building confidence with R, and Kirsten doesn’t specialize in AI systems — so this must stay use-focused.   |
| **Buyers Want Results, Not Demos** | “Cool tech” is not enough. If you can’t tie it to a *real workflow*, clients may enjoy it but not pay for more.          |

## 🥈 Tier 2: **High Impact, Slightly More Work**

### 💡 **Team Values & Motivation Scan**

* **Why:** Simple surveys, clear outputs, easy to repeat. Slightly more manual unless you automate the reporting.
* **Caution:** Doesn’t always lead to follow-up unless paired with a program.
* **Best Use:** As a diagnostic before workshops or reboarding.

---

### 💡 **Stakeholder Alignment Through Narrative & Systems Design**

* **Why:** Plays to Kirsten’s narrative strength and your system mapping.
* **Caution:** Needs the right client and clarity on ROI. Harder to pitch cold.
* **Best Use:** Bundle inside larger engagements, like ClearRoots or ecosystem design.

---

## 🥉 Tier 3: **Complex, Valuable — But Not Yet**

### 🧠 **Sustainable Practice Intelligence Hub (Prototype)**

* **Why:** Bold, meaningful — but needs tech + stakeholder readiness.
* **Caution:** Too slow and undefined to get paid fast. Save for grants, EU calls, or a case you’ve already won.

### ⚙️ **Workforce Reset & Reboarding Program**

* **Why:** Strong positioning, but emotionally heavy and time-intensive.
* **Caution:** Only pursue if a client already *asks* for change management or post-reorg support.
