## 🥇 Tier 1: **Start Here (High ROI, Low Friction)**

### ✅ **Agile Innovation & Sustainability Workshop**

* **Why:** You’ve both done this. Requires almost no new content. High perceived value.
* **Delivery:** 1-day or multi-day → you can iterate fast
* **Tools:** Beer Game, retros, team templates — ready to go
* **Clients:** Universities, incubators, HR/ESG departments
* **Scales into:** Coaching, infrastructure, culture work
  **👉 Do this first. Make it your lead product.**

---

### ✅ **Sustainable Culture Activation**

* **Why:** Surveys + workshops = credible and effective. You both think in systems, behavior, and ethics.
* **Delivery:** Use YAML templates + R for light analysis.
* **Tools:** Can build on what you already use (Beer Game, team canvases, YAML-based practice library)
* **Clients:** Mid-sized orgs facing ESG, CSRD, or internal culture alignment
* **Scales into:** Playbooks, reboarding, governance tooling
  **👉 This can evolve from the agile workshops. Great “next offer” once you build trust.**

## 🥈 Tier 2: **High Impact, Slightly More Work**

### 💡 **Team Values & Motivation Scan**

* **Why:** Simple surveys, clear outputs, easy to repeat. Slightly more manual unless you automate the reporting.
* **Caution:** Doesn’t always lead to follow-up unless paired with a program.
* **Best Use:** As a diagnostic before workshops or reboarding.

---

### 💡 **Stakeholder Alignment Through Narrative & Systems Design**

* **Why:** Plays to Kirsten’s narrative strength and your system mapping.
* **Caution:** Needs the right client and clarity on ROI. Harder to pitch cold.
* **Best Use:** Bundle inside larger engagements, like ClearRoots or ecosystem design.

---

## 🥉 Tier 3: **Complex, Valuable — But Not Yet**

### 🧠 **Sustainable Practice Intelligence Hub (Prototype)**

* **Why:** Bold, meaningful — but needs tech + stakeholder readiness.
* **Caution:** Too slow and undefined to get paid fast. Save for grants, EU calls, or a case you’ve already won.

### ⚙️ **Workforce Reset & Reboarding Program**

* **Why:** Strong positioning, but emotionally heavy and time-intensive.
* **Caution:** Only pursue if a client already *asks* for change management or post-reorg support.
