# 🧭 Strategic Introduction

This document outlines a focused portfolio of professional service offerings developed by Christiaan Verhoef and Kirsten Coppoolse. The intent is not to chase trends or scale prematurely, but to establish a grounded, realistic starting point that reflects our shared strengths, values, and working style.

After a period of broad ideation and exploration, this offering set was narrowed through three filters:

1. **Personal Fit** — What can we deliver with confidence, clarity, and integrity right now?
2. **Market Reality** — What do teams and organizations actually need and pay for in this current climate?
3. **Strategic Traction** — What gives us momentum, visibility, and the ability to grow into larger systems work over time?

Each offer has been critically evaluated for delivery risk, client clarity, and downstream opportunity. Together, they form a coherent foundation from which we can operate confidently — not just as service providers, but as collaborators in systems change.

---

## 🧠 1. These Offers Build on What We Already Do Well

We’re not reinventing ourselves. All three services rely on our existing strengths:

- **Kirsten’s ability to create clarity, safety, and structure** in emotionally complex conversations
- **Christiaan’s strength in systems, facilitation, and tools** that work in unpredictable settings
- We’ve both delivered variations of these offers already — so the risk is low, and the payoff is real

This isn’t a new direction — it’s a focused refinement of what we *already* do well.

---

## ⚖️ 2. The Scope Is Honest, the Delivery Is Realistic

We’re not pretending to sell a startup or a scalable SaaS.  
Instead, we are:

- Offering **well-bounded, human-focused services**
- Using tools we actually know and control
- Avoiding technical dependencies that could fail under pressure (e.g. AI APIs)
- Leaving room to **grow into** automation, R, or infra work later — on our terms

This protects our integrity and avoids burnout or overpromising.

---

## 💡 3. These Offers Unlock Both Money and Momentum

- **Agile + Culture Activation** can get us in the room with clients who need *more* than just training.
- They lead naturally to longer engagements: onboarding, systems design, facilitation, hiring support.
- They create **visible, shareable artifacts** (maps, toolkits, feedback reports) that build our reputation.
- And the **AI workshop** gives us a way to answer the “do you do AI?” question without building something we can’t support.

These aren’t one-offs. They’re momentum starters.

---

## 🧭 4. They Let Us Build on Our Terms, Together

We’re not scrambling for relevance in someone else’s system.
Instead:

- We choose the clients
- We choose the frame (values, ethics, transparency)
- We stay agile in how we show up and deliver
- And we’re working in a way that respects our own boundaries and pace

This creates long-term strategic room to build bigger things — VCH, ClearRoots, open tooling — without sacrificing focus or financial stability.

---

## ✨ Summary: Why Say Yes Now

- These offers are real, deliverable, and clear.
- They protect what we value while activating what we’re best at.
- They give us financial and reputational traction.
- And they’re grounded, not performative — which is rare right now.

🧩 This isn’t the whole future.  
🚀 But it’s the best possible **starting point** — and we’re ready.


### ✅ What’s **Very Strong**

These two offers are rock solid and should be the core of your immediate outreach:

#### 1. **Agile Innovation & Sustainability Workshop**

* It’s field-tested, has clear outcomes, and you both shine in delivery.
* Low tech dependency, high energy and credibility.
* Your pricing is appropriate for institutions, NGOs, and innovation hubs.

#### 2. **Sustainable Culture Activation**

* Realistic tools (Google Forms, Miro, Canva) mean you can ship this tomorrow.
* The pairing of story + system works beautifully here — Kirsten makes sense of human data, Christiaan builds visual outputs and habits.
* Nicely scoped to lead to deeper work (onboarding, team design, ethics, etc.).

---

### ⚠️ What’s **Risky But Salvageable**

#### 3. **Use A.I. Responsibly Workshop**

**Where it almost breaks:**

* ⚠️ The **value to the client** isn’t guaranteed unless their team is already asking "how do we use AI safely?"
* ⚠️ The **demo fragility** is a real risk: OpenWebUI/Ollama can fail in live sessions, especially on client hardware or low-resourced machines.
* ⚠️ There’s an **educational gap** between what *you know well* (infra) and what clients *think* AI is (magic problem-solver).
* ⚠️ It’s harder to sell cold. No one wants “another AI workshop” unless it's solving a problem they feel.

---

### 🧠 Realistic Fixes

If you keep this offer:

* Rename it more clearly: e.g.,
  ✅ **"AI Reality Check"**
  ✅ **"Intro to Private, Practical AI Tools"**
  ✅ **"Exploring AI Without the Hype"**

* Scope it down even more:

  * **1 demo + 1 use case mapping + 1 values conversation**

* Position it **as an add-on or follow-up** to Agile or Culture Activation.
  It works better once you’ve earned trust, not as the entry point.

- It positions you as ethical, realistic, and independent of Big Tech platforms
- It requires minimal development — the tools are already running locally
- It can easily lead to culture, training, or infrastructure follow-up work

### 🚫 What This Is Not
- Not a technical build-out or automation delivery
- Not an AI product workshop or ML training
- Not a replacement for full AI ops consulting — this is exploration and literacy

| Concern                            | Why It Matters                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hype vs. Value Gap**             | Many orgs are confused. They say “AI” but mean “chatbot” or “automation.” You risk being asked for what you don’t offer. |
| **Delivery Fragility**             | If you promise too much and the tools glitch (e.g., Ollama breaks, LLM fails), trust is lost.                            |
| **Your Stack is Not Fully Ready**  | You’re still building confidence with R, and Kirsten doesn’t specialize in AI systems — so this must stay use-focused.   |
| **Buyers Want Results, Not Demos** | “Cool tech” is not enough. If you can’t tie it to a *real workflow*, clients may enjoy it but not pay for more.          |

## 🥈 Tier 2: **High Impact, Slightly More Work**

### 💡 **Team Values & Motivation Scan**

* **Why:** Simple surveys, clear outputs, easy to repeat. Slightly more manual unless you automate the reporting.
* **Caution:** Doesn’t always lead to follow-up unless paired with a program.
* **Best Use:** As a diagnostic before workshops or reboarding.

---

### 💡 **Stakeholder Alignment Through Narrative & Systems Design**

* **Why:** Plays to Kirsten’s narrative strength and your system mapping.
* **Caution:** Needs the right client and clarity on ROI. Harder to pitch cold.
* **Best Use:** Bundle inside larger engagements, like ClearRoots or ecosystem design.

---

## 🥉 Tier 3: **Complex, Valuable — But Not Yet**

### 🧠 **Sustainable Practice Intelligence Hub (Prototype)**

* **Why:** Bold, meaningful — but needs tech + stakeholder readiness.
* **Caution:** Too slow and undefined to get paid fast. Save for grants, EU calls, or a case you’ve already won.

### ⚙️ **Workforce Reset & Reboarding Program**

* **Why:** Strong positioning, but emotionally heavy and time-intensive.
* **Caution:** Only pursue if a client already *asks* for change management or post-reorg support.
