# Chris's wants to become

# üå± Chris' Aspiration Summary

Chris wants to become someone who:

- **Lives with autonomy**, making intentional choices aligned with personal values rather than reacting to external pressure.
- **Builds deep competence** by completing meaningful work, learning continuously, and applying skills in real-world contexts (e.g., project management, data-driven decision-making).
- **Feels connected** through healthy, reciprocal relationships and collaboration, especially in purpose-driven communities.
- **Takes responsibility** for life direction, including improving organization, follow-through, and financial discipline.
- **Treats himself with care**, practicing self-discipline and kindness as if he were someone he was responsible for helping.
- **Overcomes self-sabotage** by replacing impulsive habits and fear-driven behavior with small, steady, sustainable actions.
- **Leads by example**, contributing to systems change and sustainability through real-world projects and ethical facilitation.
- **Becomes reliable and trustworthy**, regaining the confidence of peers and building strong working relationships.
